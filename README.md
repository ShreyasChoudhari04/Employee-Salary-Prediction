** 💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning.** 

It uses machine learning regression to predict employee salaries based on features like education, job title, experience, and more.

🚀 Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that can predict the numeric salary of employees by analyzing historical data using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm.

🧠 Technologies Used

Python
Google Colab
Pandas & NumPy
Scikit-learn
Random Forest Regressor

📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features:
Age
Gender
Education Level
Job Title
Years of Experience
Train Salary( used as target variable)

🛠️ Model & Accuracy

-Model: Random Forest Regressor
Accuracy (R² Score): 99.75%
Features were preprocessed using One-Hot Encoding. Missing values were cleaned and the model was trained/tested with an 80/20 split.

📈 Results

The model successfully predicts salaries based on job-related inputs with high accuracy. Predicted salaries were added as a new column (Predicted Salary) to the dataset.
