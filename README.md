🛠️ Model & Accuracy

Model: Random Forest Regressor:
        1) Accuracy (R² Score): 94%.
                  2)Features were preprocessed using One-Hot Encoding. Missing values were cleaned and the model was trained/tested with an 80/20 split.

📈 Results

The model successfully predicts salaries based on job-related inputs with high accuracy. Predicted salaries were added as a new column (Predicted Salary) to the dataset.
